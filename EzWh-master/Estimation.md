# Project Estimation  
Date: 11/04/2022

Version: 1.0


# Estimation approach
Consider the EZWH  project as described in YOUR requirement document, assume that you are going to develop the project INDEPENDENT of the deadlines of the course
# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |          10                   |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |           300                 | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 3000|
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |            300                          |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 9000| 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |       10 days for person             |               

# Estimate by product decomposition
### 
|         component name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|requirement document    | 20|
| GUI prototype |8|
|design document |10|
|code |300|
| unit tests |20|
| api tests |20|
| management documents  |10|



# Estimate by activity decomposition
### 
|         Activity name    | Estimated effort (person hours)   |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | 
|Identify user requirements| 8 hours |
|Identify stakeholders| 4 hours|
|Context diagram| 8 hours|
|Interfaces| 8 hours|
|Stories and Personas|8 hours|
|Functional and non functional requirements| 8 hours|
|Use case diagram and use case| 16 hours|
|Glossary| 8 hours|
|System diagram| 8 hours|
|GUI prototype| 8 hours|
|Coding| 300 hours|
|Tests| 40 hours|

# Summary

Report here the results of the three estimation approaches. The  estimates may differ. Discuss here the possible reasons for the difference

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size | 300 person hours| 75 hours|
| estimate by product decomposition |388 person hours| 97 hours|
| estimate by activity decomposition | 424 person hours |15 days |

The duration can be different because more persons can work in parallel. If we consider that person hours are divided equally by four people, we will divide the estimated effort by four. Also it's important to consider weekends and holidays that will increas the duration time.
